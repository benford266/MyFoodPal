# FoodPal Refactoring Notes

## Overview
The main.py file (originally 2101 lines) has been refactored into a clean, modular structure. This improves maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## New Structure

```

│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── endpoints.py          # FastAPI routes and endpoints
├── database/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── connection.py         # Database setup and connection
│   ├── models.py             # SQLAlchemy database models
│   └── operations.py         # Database CRUD operations

```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Database layer**: Models, connections, and operations separated
- **Business logic**: Recipe generation isolated in services
- **UI components**: Pages and display components organized
- **Utilities**: Reusable functions in dedicated modules

### 2. Better Maintainability
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- Clear import dependencies

### 3. Testability
- Individual components can be unit tested
- Mock dependencies easily for testing
- Clear interfaces between modules

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add new features without modifying core files
- New UI pages can be added to ui/ directory
- New services can be added to services/ directory

## Migration Details

### Database Layer
- `models.py`: Contains User, MealPlan, RecipeRating models
- `connection.py`: Database engine and session management
- `operations.py`: All database CRUD operations

### Services
- `recipe_generator.py`: RecipeGenerator class with Ollama integration
- Handles single recipe and batch recipe generation

### UI Components
- `pages.py`: Main UI routes (login, main page, history, meal plan detail)
- `recipe_display.py`: Recipe and shopping list display components
- `meal_plan_display.py`: Detailed meal plan view components

### Utilities
- `theme.py`: Theme management and CSS classes
- `session.py`: User session storage and management
- `pdf_export.py`: PDF generation functionality
- `recipe_parser.py`: Recipe response parsing with fallbacks
- `shopping_list.py`: Shopping list consolidation logic

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Database schema unchanged
- API endpoints maintained
- UI behavior identical

## Running the Application
The application runs exactly the same as before:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Benefits for Future Development
1. **Easy to add new features**: Clear structure for new components
2. **Better debugging**: Isolated components make issues easier to track
3. **Team development**: Multiple developers can work on different modules
4. **Code reuse**: Utilities and services can be imported by multiple components
5. **Testing**: Each module can be tested independently

## Backup
The original main.py has been backed up as `main_backup.py` for reference.
